# Coup Game (Python Implementation)

Welcome to the **Coup Game** repository! This project provides two versions of the popular card game **Coup**, implemented in Python. You can play either a multiplayer version with friends or a single-player version against AI opponents.

## ðŸ“œ About the Project

This repository contains two versions of the game:

1. **`coup.py`** â€“ A multiplayer version of Coup that supports **2 to 6 players**.
2. **`coup+`** â€“ A single-player version where one human player can compete against **1 to 5 AI-controlled opponents**.

Both versions follow the standard **Coup** rules, where players use deception, deduction, and strategy to eliminate their opponents and be the last one standing.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

### Multiplayer Version (`coup.py`)
- Supports **2-6 players**.

- Requires human players to input actions.

### Single-Player Version (`coup+`)
- Only **one human player** is allowed.
- The player can choose between **1-5 AI opponents** to compete against.
- AI players follow Coup strategies to challenge the human player.
